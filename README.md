# Introduction
This is a code repository

In this project, I have tried to create a full Realtime Chat Application. I'm going to use  React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 

I'm Trying my hands on MERN stack and this is my second on trying to be a full stack. 

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
